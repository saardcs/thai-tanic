### Key Features:
- **Combination Exploration**: Choose from 3 main courses and 2 desserts to create unique meal combos.
- **Progress Tracker**: The app keeps a record of selected combos, ensuring no combo is repeated.
- **Completion Celebration**: Once all possible combos are selected, the app shows a fun success message and balloons.
- **QR Code for Practice on Mobile**: A QR code is generated, allowing students to scan and access the interactive combo practice on their mobile devices.

### Based On:
This app is based on a combinatorics [activity](https://www.transum.org/Maths/Exercise/Listing/Default.asp?Level=3) from [Transum.org](https://www.transum.org/), where students are asked to determine how many different meal combinations are possible from a menu with 3 main courses and 2 desserts.
